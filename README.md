# BIKE RENTAL PREDICTION MODEL üö≤üìä

## Project Summary üìù

The **Bike Rental Prediction Model** (ONGOING PROJECT) aims to create a model using historical data and Scikit-Learn's RandomForestRegressor that forecasts daily bike rental demand based on various factors. Helping the business optimize staffing, inventory management, and revenue.

### Project Steps üõ§ <a name="Installation"></a>

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Download data from the following sources:
     - Original Source: <http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data>
     - Weather Info: <http://www.freemeteo.com>
     - Holiday Schedule: <http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule>
     - Data Downloaded for Model Development: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset?select=hour.csv>

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform EDA to explore the distribution of bike rentals.
   - Visualize correlations and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Identify key features impacting bike rentals, such as weather, holidays, and seasonal changes.
  
3. **Model Development:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the **RandomForestRegressor** model and tune hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

4. **Save Model for Future Use:**
   - Use `joblib` to save the model for future deployment and predictions.

5. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document the entire process, from data sources to model details.
   - Provide visualizations for actual vs. predicted values.

6. **Future Work:**
   - Update the dataset periodically and test the model with new data.
   - Experiment with different models and hyperparameters for better performance.
   - Consider real-time predictions in a deployment scenario.

#### Notes üìå <a name="Notes"></a>

- **Data Sources**: Original bike-sharing data, weather data, and holiday schedules were used to build this model.
- **Model Updates**: The model is designed for future improvements, such as using a more up-to-date dataset and experimenting with different models.
- **Deployment**: The model is exportable for deployment in production environments using `joblib`.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as MSE and R-squared were used to measure the model's performance.
- **Maintenance**: Future work will include refining the model with additional data and testing deployment scenarios for real-time predictions.
